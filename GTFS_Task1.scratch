// Download and extract GTFS data
    // Download the GTFS data that you have been provided 
    extract the contents of the zip fairfield
// Explore GTFS files
    // open the extracted folder and look for the mentioned text files (stop.txt, routes.txt, trips.txt. stop_times.txt)
//Understand key files 
    // Focus on understanding the structure and content of the following files:
        // stops.txt: Information about stops, including their names and locations.
        // routes.txt: Details about transit routes, such as route IDs and names.
        // trips.txt: Describes individual trips on the routes.
        // stop_times.txt: Contains the timings of stops for each trip.
    // Explore stop_times.txt
        // open and explore the stop_times.txt
        // this file provides information about the timings of stops for each trip. 
    // verify routes and directions
        // Confirm that the relevant routes (CC,East,0 and CC,West,1) are present and have associated trips in the data.
        // Ensure that you understand the meaning of the columns, such as trip_id, stop_id, arrival_time, and departure_time.
    // Next steps: 
        // once you have a good understanding of the GTFS data, you can proceed to integrate and utilize this data in your application or project. This may involve creating schedules, displauing route information, and more.
